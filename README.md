# ReplicationChallengeQICSS

Through this project I am attempting to meet the challenge of replicating the entirety of display items in Demerci 2020 paper (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/caje.12478). 
In a first step I have successfully replicated the display items using files provided by the author. This allowed me to establish an assessment of paper original reproduction package.

A second phase is devoted to improving the original package provided by the author. In this stage I carried out three main actions: 

1) I added many missing files: raw data and cleaning codes. 

2) I adapted the main code so that it runs independently of the Stata version used. This allowed to solve incompatibilities between some commands and some versions of Stata (version 17 for example). 
I also reorganised the reproduction package into several data and code subfolders in order to give a better structure. 

3) I have improved display items reproducibility level  by adding many important details in a new README file. A data availability statement has also been provided.
